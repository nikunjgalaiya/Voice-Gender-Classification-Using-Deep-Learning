# 🗣️ Voice Gender Recognition using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **deep learning-based voice gender classification system** that takes an audio file and predicts the speaker's gender — *male* or *female*. With the increasing integration of voice-enabled systems into modern devices and virtual assistants, voice-based biometric recognition is becoming essential for personalization and accessibility.

We use a combination of **feature extraction**, **classical ML**, **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**, and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, trained on the **OPENSLR12 (LibriSpeech) dataset**. The system is further enhanced by deployment-ready Flask APIs and model voting logic for robustness.
